- VS floaty + spacy teams, common neutral positioning is for one teammate to play conservative keepout on the floaty while the other 1v1's the spacy, then the keepout teammate joins in for hard punishes or rescues on the other players

---

- Shield less in neutral

---

- Execute spacies off stage (i.e. fox shines fox offstage during 4-player squab, sheik follows up by aerialing opponent's jump back to stage)
- Go for hard-hitting reads on edgeguards rather than safe/rinse and repeat plays
- If spacies are below stage prioritize offstage edgeguards rather than staying on stage
- Assume spacies will recover high/on-stage unless proven otherwise (or at juicy panic side b range)

---

- DO NOT SWING WHEN COMING DOWN IF TEAMMATE IS THE NEAREST PLAYER
- When coming down from angel platform help teammate as priority #1, do not let someone combo/edgeguard teammate for free
- When teammate is sandwiched between opponents at close range with shield up, attempt to disrupt closest opponent as soon as possible (rather than dash dancing anticating opponent to approach you <--- important note)
- When teammate is being edgeguarded and you are not being comboed, attempt to disrupt
- If you hit both teammate and 1 opponent, generally be prepared to defend teammate from other opponent's followups
